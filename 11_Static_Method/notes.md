# Use Case of Static Methods and properties

- Defining Method and Properties as static you can access them with class name.

- Instead of writing functions outside you can write static class and define function inside it.

- When we use OOPS we do not write anything outside the class there static methods and properties help us to access them without creating any object or instance of the class
